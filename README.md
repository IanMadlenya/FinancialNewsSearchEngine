## Commands

If you want to run from an IDE (e.g. Intellij), you could have problems because of the resources managed by _wro4j_ are not downloaded. Thus I advise you to use the following commands from the terminal.

### Clean and Install the app

    mvn clean install
    
    
### Run the SpringBoot app

    mvn spring-boot:run
    
### Access the app from the browser

After the execution of the command `mvn spring-boot:run`, go to your favourite browser and type the following URL:

    localhost:3000
